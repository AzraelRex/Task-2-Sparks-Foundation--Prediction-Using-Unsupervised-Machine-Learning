# Task-2-Sparks-Foundation--Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
This is my second task for the Sparks Foundation- Data Science And Business Analytics Internship


Greetings everybody, my name is Azrael Rex B. Anacleto. Today I am bringing you my output for Task 2 of the Sparks Foundation Data Science And Business Analytics Internship. Here we will be using the popular python libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and inline, along with once more scikit-learn library this time with clustering. My main aim with this task  is to utilize unsupervised learning, specifically the K-which stands for the clustering algorithm, on the Iris dataset which was given to us by the Sparks Foundation.  I need to identify what is the most suitable number of clusters within the dataset, furthermore visually present these clusters.
