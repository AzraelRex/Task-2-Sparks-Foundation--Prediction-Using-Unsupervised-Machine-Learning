# Task-2-Sparks-Foundation--Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
This is my second task for the Sparks Foundation- Data Science And Business Analytics Internship


Greetings everybody, my name is Azrael Rex B. Anacleto. Today I am bringing you my output for Task 2 of the Sparks Foundation Data Science And Business Analytics Internship. Here we will be using the popular python libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and inline, along with once more scikit-learn library this time with clustering. My main aim with this task  is to utilize unsupervised learning, specifically the K-which stands for the clustering algorithm, on the Iris dataset which was given to us by the Sparks Foundation.  I need to identify what is the most suitable number of clusters within the dataset, furthermore visually present these clusters.

Also this is a very good internship so everyone that is interested in Data Science, Human Resources, Web Development, Mobile Application Development and many more should definitely apply to this internship as it is 100% free and worth it. You can apply for it here. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTmzfiKkbfS2yjmabn3XczfaEVYnw4xgO5NfThPebxZnlc8Q/viewform
